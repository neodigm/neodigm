            <p>I have experience making large eCommerce sites accessible. I’ve authored style guides and best practices that have helped disparate teams achieve WCAG success criteria.</p>

            <p>In order for improvements to stand the test of time, there must be a company culture that supports accessibility and be willing to make it a requirement even when faced with competing priorities. For example, imagine explaining to an art director that the brand colors cannot be perceived by the colorblind. Imagine telling an SEO consultant that there are too many characters in an alt attribute. These can be awkward conversations if a11y is not prioritized within the organization.</p>

            <p>Ecom sites are particularly challenging because they are always changing. Product information and imagery are managed within a CMS, therefore, there is always a risk of newly-added content being inaccessible. Ideally this situation would be addressed with a cyclical audit. That is a web crawler that captures a11y issues throughout the entire site. Similarly an a11y audit could run as part of automated unit testing upon software build or check in.</p>
            <p>Finding a11y issues during development is preferred but keep in mind the developers will require more time to become proficient in this discipline and the project estimates should reflect that.</p>
            <p>Another challenge for ecom sites is interaction complexity. Components such as carousels, mini shopping carts, and promotional popup dialogs are transitional and difficult to describe to the visually impaired. The fact that these interactions are actuated with JavaScript makes it impractical to test automatically. I’ve found the best way to find and fix these types of interactions is with a screen reader and then applying state-full ARIA patterns attributes as needed.</p>

            <p>Achieving accessibility nirvana is not easy for an eCommerce site. Try to think of it in terms of exposing your business to a new group of shoppers who would have trouble shopping at your competitor’s site.</p>
