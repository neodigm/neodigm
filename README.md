I am a product storyteller, UX artisan, illustrator, front-end engineer, and prolific open source contributor. I define digital products with persuasive infographics, succinct [data visualizations](https://www.TheScottKrause.com/d3_datavis_skills.html), and interactive dashboards.

I code performant, functional, testable, future-proof, and trusted JavaScript, TypeScript, and Go. I've enchanted the UX for Abbott Laboratories, CDW, Corporate Express, Hyundai, Microsoft, and Sears.
