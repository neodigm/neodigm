I am a product storyteller, [UX](https://www.thescottkrause.com/categories/ux/) artisan, illustrator, front-end engineer, and prolific [open source contributor](https://thescottkrause.com/emerging_tech/neodigm55_ux_library/). I define digital products with hyper-persuasive infographics, succinct [data visualizations](https://www.TheScottKrause.com/d3_datavis_skills.html), and interactive dashboards.

I code performant, functional, testable, future-proof, and trusted [JavaScript](https://www.thescottkrause.com/tags/javascript/), [TypeScript](https://www.thescottkrause.com/emerging_tech/curated-typescript-links/), and Svelte. I've enchanted the UX for Abbott Laboratories, Abbvie, CDW, Corporate Express, Hyundai, Microsoft, and Sears.
