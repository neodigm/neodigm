            <p class="readable__doc">Google has announced that Universal Analytics will stop collecting data on July 1st, 2023. That means that you have a limited time to migrate to Google Analytics 4 (GA4).</p>
            <p class="readable__doc">While one option is to flip the switch in about a year from now, that means you won't have any access to historical data in your GA4 account. Here I provide the infomation that you are going to need to ensure a smooth roll-out of the new Analytics system.</p>

                        <p>If you can't measure it, you can't manage it.</p>
                        <p>You should have continuous data from before and after the switch to GA4. The better tracking data you have, the better analytics and insights go towards increasing your sales and revenue.</p>
