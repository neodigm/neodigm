            <p>An eclectic low-code vanilla JavaScript UX micro-library for those that defiantly think for themselves.</p> 
            <p>This project is the result of many years of UX work on some pretty demanding websites.</p>
            <p>These few components have evolved and become a necessity for any site that needs to engage and delight quickly.</p>

            <p>Alice dresses not to impress. She removes jewelry and covers body ink / scars. Her Wayfarers and black bike helmet thwart facial recognition.</p> 
            <p>Alice leaves her phone and ID at home and hops on a mountain bike and takes the scenic route (avoiding intersections with cameras) to the drop location. She inconspicuously attaches the capsule to a fixed object with the magnet or the attached carabiner. Our heroine takes a different route home.</p>

            <p>Later that very night Bob arrives at the dead drop sans smartphone, smart watch, or Fitbit. He retrieves the package and vanishes. In the unfortunate event that Bob is captured the device should have a panic / duress password that is easy to remember (rubber-hose cryptanalysis). Entering this password would effectively shred the encryption key (we will give Bob a Dead Man's Switch (DMS) in a future story).</p> 
            <p>Bob safely retrieves the package. The unbroken seal suggests that it has not been tampered with. He enters an incorrect password once to be certain the device does not unlock. Bob understands that an adversary may have swapped the device with a faux unit custom programed to store and transmit all password attempts via burst bluetooth or net.</p> 
            <p>Later when Bob is safe from prying eyes and cameras he enters the correct password and boots an air-gapped laptop from the very same device.</p>

            <p>The night becomes tomorrow. Data becomes information. Information becomes knowledge. Knowledge becomes wisdom. Wisdom fuels strategy.</p> 
            <p>Godspeed Alice and Bob and may your sweet nothings secure and endure.</p>
