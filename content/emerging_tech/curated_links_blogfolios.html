summary: "Personal Websites"
marquee: " Personal sites take many different forms, some are blogs, portfolios, resumes, recipes, hobbyist, or creative. I enjoy discovering an interesting site authored by an independent soul. It makes me feel like I found an actual person in a sea of boring AI generated mediocrity. Search engines lose these types of sites because they don‚Äôt generate revenue, but I seek them out. "
